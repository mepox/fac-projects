                <p>I am applying for the programme to learn more about Web Development as I have always been interested in this field.</p>
                <p>I enjoy the challenges it gives and that it let me use my creative problem-solving skills. Also, I would like to improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills too, 
                    so I can make a better looking, user friendly and responsive websites.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I found this programme just a few days before the latest deadline so I had only a few days to complete the projects. I managed to 
                    complete all of them by focusing on the requirements. I enjoyed the journey and already learnt a lot.</p>
                <p>All projects are written from scratch, no external libraries or frameworks were used.</p>
