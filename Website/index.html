                    <p>I am applying for the programme to learn more about Web Development as I have always been interested in this field.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy the challenges it gives and that it let me use my creative problem-solving skills. I would like to improve my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills too, 
                        so I can make a better looking and more user friendly websites.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I found this programme just a few days before the latest deadline so I had only a few days to complete the projects. I managed to 
                        complete all of them. They are written from scratch, no libraries or frameworks were used.</p>
